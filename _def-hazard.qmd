##### Hazard function

::: notes
The **hazard function** for a random variable $T$ at value $t$,
typically denoted as $h(t)$ or $\lambda(t)$,
is the conditional [density](probability.qmd#def-pdf) of $T$ at $t$, 
given $T\ge t$.
That is:
::::

$$h(t) \eqdef p(T=t|T\ge t)$$

If $T$ represents the time at which an event occurs, then $h(t)$ is the probability that the event occurs at time $t$, given that it has
not occurred prior to time $t$.
