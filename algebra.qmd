## Elementary Algebra

::: notes
Mastery of [Elementary Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_algebra) (a.k.a. "College Algebra")  is a prerequisite for calculus, 
which is a prerequisite for Epi 202 and Epi 203,
which are prerequisites for this course (Epi 204).
Nevertheless, each year, 
some Epi 204 students are still uncomfortable
with algebraic manipulations of mathematical formulas.
Therefore, I include this section as a quick reference.

### Equality

:::{#thm-equal-trans}
#### Equality is transitive

If $a=b$ and $b=c$, then $a=c$

:::

---

:::{#thm-substitution}
#### Substituting equivalent expressions

If $a = b$, then for any function $f(x)$, $f(a) = f(b)$

:::

---

### Sums

---

:::{#thm-add-ident}
#### adding zero changes nothing
$$a+0=a$$
:::

---

:::{#thm-sum-symmetric}
#### Sums are symmetric

$$a+b = b+a$$

:::

---

:::{#thm-sum-assoc}
#### Sums are associative

::: notes
When summing three or more terms, the order in which you sum them does not matter:
:::

$$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$

:::

---

### Products

---

:::{#thm-mult-one}
#### Multiplying by 1 changes nothing

$$a \times 1 = a$$
:::

---

:::{#thm-prod-symmetric}

#### Products are symmetric

$$a \times b = b \times a$$
:::

---

:::{#thm-prod-assoc}
#### Products are associative

$$(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$$
:::

### Sums and products together

---

:::{#thm-mult-distr}
#### Multiplication is distributive

$$a(b+c) = ab + ac$$
:::

### Inequalities

---

:::{#thm-add-ineq}

If $a<b$, then $a+c < b+c$

:::

---

:::{#thm-neg-ineq}
#### negating both sides of an inequality
If $a < b$, then: $-a > -b$

:::

---

:::{#thm-mult-ineq}
If $a < b$ and $c \geq 0$, then $ca < cb$.

:::

---

:::{#thm-negative-one}

$$-a = (-1)*a$$

:::

## Logarithms and Exponentials

:::{#thm-log-prod}
#### logarithm of a product is the sum of the logs of the factors
$$
\log{a\cd b} = \log{a} + \log{b}
$$

:::

:::{#cor-log-quot}
#### logarithm of a quotient

::: notes
The logarithm of a quotient is equal to the difference of the logs of the factors:
:::

$$\log{\frac{a}{b}} = \log{a} - \log{b}$$
:::

:::{#thm-log-exp}
#### logarithm of an exponential function
$$
\log{a^b} = b \cd \log{a}
$$

:::

:::{#thm-exp-sum}
#### exponential of a sum

::: notes
The exponential of a sum is equal to the product of the exponentials of the addends:
:::

$$\exp{a+b} = \exp{a} \cd \exp{b}$$

:::

:::{#cor-exp-sum}
#### exponential of a difference

::: notes
The exponential of a difference is equal to the quotient of the exponentials of the addends:
:::

$$\exp{a-b} = \frac{\exp{a}}{\exp{b}}$$
